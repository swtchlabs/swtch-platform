# SWTCH WhitePaper

## Introduction
#### Purpose
SWTCH proposes a wide range of functionalities from identity management to decentralized payments and token management providing a comprehensive approach for decentralized applications. By supporting multiple blockchains and integrating various identity solutions the SWTCH Platform aims to be highly interoperable, catering to a broad user base. 

#### WhitePaper Scope
The document covers:
- [Abstract](./Abstract.md)
- [Identity](./Identity.md)
- [Tokenomics](./Tokenomics.md)
- [Architecture](./Architecture.md)
- [Orchestration](./Orchestration.md)
- [Use Cases](./UseCases.md)

#### Audience
This white paper is intended for developers building the SDK and those integrating with the SWTCH Platform.

## Core Capabilities
#### Identity Management
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Incorporates standards like ERC-725 and ERC-735 along with solutions such as Civic and Polygon ID to provide a robust identity framework.
- Secure Interactions: Ensures secure and verifiable interactions across the platform using advanced cryptographic techniques.

#### Architecture
- Composable Network Infrastructure: The platform's architecture supports a modular and composable approach, allowing various services to interact seamlessly.
- Multi-Chain Support: Deployed on multiple EVM-compatible blockchains and plans to extend to other networks like Cosmos and Solana, ensuring wide accessibility and interoperability.
- Decentralized Nodes: Includes specialized nodes for messaging, storage, computation, and AI agent services, each integrated with the SWTCH SDK to enable secure and efficient operations.

#### Orchestration
- Executive Functionality: Provides the capability for an Executive to orchestrate and manage the available functions or "activations" of decentralized nodes. This involves configuring settings that nodes understand to update their local runtime and execute specific tasks.
- Dynamic Management: Ensures that nodes can adapt to changing requirements and execute tasks as needed, enhancing the platform's flexibility and responsiveness.

#### Decentralized Payments and Token Management:
- Payment Channels: Facilitates the creation and management of various payment channels, including one-way, bi-directional, and escrow services.
- Token Standards: Supports multiple token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, etc.) for diverse use cases and enhanced interoperability.
- Fee and Reward Distribution: Manages the secure and accurate distribution of fees and rewards based on contributions and service usage.

By integrating these core capabilities, the SWTCH Platform provides a secure, flexible, and scalable solution for decentralized applications, empowering developers and users to build and interact with next-generation decentralized services.
