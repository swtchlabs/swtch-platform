# Identity

## Decentralized Identities
A Decentralized Identifier (DID) represents any subject, which could be a person, organization, thing, data model, or abstract entity. The controller of the DID determines the subject.

DIDs are designed to be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.

## How DIDs Function
DIDs are stored on distributed ledgers (blockchains) or peer-to-peer networks. This ensures that they are globally unique, resolvable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable.

Each DID can be associated with different entities, including individuals, organizations, or government institutions.

## Benefits of Decentralized Identities
DIDs empower users to manage their identity-related information without relying on central authorities. Users can create identifiers and hold attestations independently.

DIDs allow trustless verification without relying on central third parties. Blockchain technology provides cryptographic guarantees for validating attestations.

Decentralized identity solutions prioritize privacy while ensuring seamless interactions.

## DIDs on SWTCH
DIDs on SWTCH are the primary form of identification on the platform for users and operators. A base identity can be created on SWTCH, or an existing identity can be imported from other decentralized providers to manage authentic and verifiable network interactions.
