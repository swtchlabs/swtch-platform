# Abstract

## A Hybridized  Web  
The technological advancements in software today are in a perpetual state of evolution. By combining the foundational patterns of the centralized internet of the past with modern decentralized applications and artificial intelligence services, we have enabled a decoupling from centralized systems that control the flow of information.

## Challenges
Delivering decentralized ideals from Web3 to traditional applications and services is not a new concept. However, we believe it needs to be fully applied across all technological contexts to be fully appreciated. Widespread Web3 adoption faces significant challenges, particularly with the complexities of wallet and identity management for organizations and everyday users.

## Proposed Approach
By adopting a decentralized identity-first approach to developing secure decentralized interactions, we enable the creation of various clients on this secure foundation. These clients utilize software development kits to build blockchain-enabled applications through a standard interface, transparently leveraging the power of a verifiable smart contract protocol.

## Goals
Our goal in developing a verifiable multi-blockchain smart contract protocol with supporting "multi-language" software development kits is to break down technological barriers within the current Web3 factions, facilitating broader adoption and integration. This is achieved by integrating common Web3 functionalities, such as signing, verifying, interacting and transacting with smart contracts, and encrypting and decrypting information with our current web services-based models.

We aim to lay the foundation for decentralized, secure, multi-party data and computing networks utilizing a common interface for messaging, storage, computation, and artificial intelligence. These base service primitives are designed to provide developers with service templates that have built-in smart contract protocol integration and verifiability.

Users and operators can interact with decentralized web services by selecting them from their respective decentralized application indexes. Decentralized identities with access-controlled indexes enable users to interact directly with web services as applications from operators, shifting the web services industry from centralized web services and fixed fee structures to a more open and competitive marketplace for information.
